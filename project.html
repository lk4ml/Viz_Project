 <p> This is an <i> attempt for understanding Regligion Spread across <strong> 5 big countries</strong><i>
 in the world. As of Today the sum  of the population of all the religions can be seen as below : </i></br>

 <ul style="list-style-type:square">
  <li>Christian - <strong>539,560,000</strong></li>
  <li>Muslim - <strong>412,810,000</strong> </li>
  <li>Bhuddist- <strong>258,920,000</strong></li>
  <li>Hindu- <strong>979,610,000</strong> </li>

</ul>

<Strong style="color: black;">Few Facts about the Populations </Strong> 
<p> <strong>China</strong> is the most populated and have the <i>bhuddist religion</i> in majority, but intresting thing is our dataset also shows that in China there are many people whose religion is unkown and thats may be because of huge population and data collection, but it will be fair if we consider most of them as bhudist only.</br>
<strong>India</strong> followed by second , and populated with <i>Hindu religion</i> </br>
<strong>USA </strong> is pouplated with Christians the most </br>
<strong>Indonasia</strong> is populated the most with 
Muslims.</br> </p>

 <p> Standing on Today , we can say Hindu(INDIA) are the highest,followed by Christianity ,and then muslims. But noticable thing here, would be the rate at which these religions are growing and for that understandning we have to see the growth rate of each religions since 1945. Now let's observe the rise of these religions years wise and see whats the rate of growth
for these religions <br><a href="Line_chart.html"><strong>Lets see the Growth over time now</strong></a> (D3.js Line Chart)
</p>

<p> After reading and seeing the growth chart , you would have the ample idea how Muslim religion is growing with time and its rate is fastest across all the other religions in the world.<br></p>
